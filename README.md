# Hadoop-custom: A Comprehensive Big Data Development Environment

## Project Overview

Hadoop-custom is a robust, Docker-based development environment designed for big data processing and analytics. This project integrates a wide array of powerful tools and technologies commonly used in the big data ecosystem, providing a complete platform for data engineers, data scientists, and analysts to develop, test, and run big data applications.

## Key Components

1. **Hadoop**: The core distributed processing framework for big data.
2. **Hive**: Data warehouse software for reading, writing, and managing large datasets.
3. **JupyterLab**: Web-based interactive development environment for data science and machine learning.
4. **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for flexible, document-oriented storage.
5. **MySQL**: Relational database management system.
6. **Elasticsearch & Kibana**: Search and analytics engine with powerful visualization capabilities.
7. **Kafka & Zookeeper**: Distributed event streaming platform for high-performance data pipelines.
8. **Prometheus & Grafana**: Monitoring and alerting toolkit with feature-rich metric visualization.
9. **Sqoop**: Tool designed for efficiently transferring bulk data between Hadoop and structured datastores.
10. **Caddy**: Web server for serving and proxying applications.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into separate directories for each major component, allowing for modular development and easy management of services:

- `caddy/`: Configuration for the Caddy web server
- `hadoop/`: Hadoop-related configurations and scripts
- `hive/`: Hive server and metastore configurations
- `jupyterlab/`: JupyterLab setup and customizations
- `mongodb/`: MongoDB configurations
- `mysql/`: MySQL database setup
- `prometheus/`: Prometheus configurations for monitoring
- `sqoop/`: Sqoop configurations for data transfer
- `web/`: Web application files (if any)
- `workspace/`: Shared workspace for development

The root directory contains a `docker-compose.yml` file that orchestrates all these services, allowing for easy deployment of the entire environment.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project:

1. Ensure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed on your system.
2. Clone this repository to your local machine.
3. Navigate to the project root directory.
4. Run `docker-compose up -d` to start all services.

For detailed setup instructions and usage guidelines, please refer to the individual README files in each component's directory.

## Use Cases

This environment is suitable for a wide range of big data projects and use cases, including:

- Developing and testing big data processing pipelines
- Conducting data analysis and visualization on large datasets
- Prototyping machine learning models with big data
- Experimenting with different big data technologies and their integrations
